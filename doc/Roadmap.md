# Empire Wand Plus - Roadmap

There are still a lot of things that need to be added to this plugin to make it feel like the real thing. Here is a small incomplete list of things we want to implement sometime soon.

### Command for binding spells to a wand

This means that there won't be a set list of spells on a specific wand, you can add and remove spells from a wand on a per-item basis. 

### Command for unbinding spells from a wand

Plays in on the previously mentioned item

### Disable explosions coming from wands

Sometimes testing without blowing up everything can be nice, that is why we want to implement a configuration option that disables any and all explosive damage done by the spells (and other sources)
