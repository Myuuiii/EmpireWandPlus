# Spark Spell Type

A spark spell can be targeted at a block that is within the spell's casting range. Any targets that are in close proximity to the target block might be dealt one or more of the following:

- Instant Damage<br>
  This is true damage that can not be reduced with armor or potions
- Potion Effects<br>
  Potion effects may be applied to a target, these effects can be removed by drinking milk
- Fire ticks<br>
  This will set the target player on fire for a few ticks. Fire ticks can be removed by standing in water
