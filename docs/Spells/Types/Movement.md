# Movement Spell Type

This is a spell that will have an impact on the players that are hit or are in close proximity to a target block. A movement spell can have impact on the following things:

- Walking
  A movement spell can for example grant the "Slowness" potion effect. This could just slow, or completely stun the target player.
- Launching
  A movement spell can launch the target player up into the air without them being able to cancel this effect other than having a block above their head.
