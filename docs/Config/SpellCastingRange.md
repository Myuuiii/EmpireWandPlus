# Change Spell Casting Range

You can change the amount of blocks of range a spell has when casting. When a block outside of this range is targeted, the spell will not execute. 

```yaml
  Blood Spark:
    Enabled: true
    Range: 25
```

To change the amount of blocks of range a spell has, change the value of the "Range" property to the amount of blocks of range you want the spell to have.

Please note that before any changes will be perceptible in game, the plugin must first be reloaded.
