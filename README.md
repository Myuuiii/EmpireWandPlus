# Aiming to immitate the wands and spells you're used to

We don't decompile other plugins to steal their effects, everything in here is made just by looking at old footage, and trying to recreate the effects as closely as possible. This plugin is a work in progress, and I'm always looking for feedback on how to improve it.

# No worries about shooting up in the air or into water

Every projectile that is fired by one of the wands will expire after a certain amount of time, so no random floating effects in your world.

# Powerful spells

These wands should radiate power, so we made sure that the spells are as powerful as they should be.

*this spell is from the Elementos wand, and usually wouldn't be on the empire wand, this is just for demonstration purposes*

Right click to change spells, left click to cast. It's that simple. Permissions are straight forward for server administrators as well!
