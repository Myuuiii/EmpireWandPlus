## Work in Progress

I've recently started working on this plugin again, you can expect a lot of updates in the coming few weeks. Here are some of the things I will be working on, this list excludes any changes that wont be visible to the user:

- [ ] Make spell effects more vivid but optimized for lower-end pcs
- [ ] Allow for spell binding to wands, instead of having a set list
- [ ] Adding more complex spells such as Mephidantes Aura (name might change), Empire Aura and Lightning Storm
- [ ] Chat messages showing up in the old style
- [x] Wand switching showing the right wand as a prefix, instead of it always being [EmpireWand]
